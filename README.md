Food-Recipe-Restaurant-App is a NextJS application where users can search their favorite recipes and also look up nearby restaurants.
The application was built according to the specifications and guidelines provided.
The returned recipes for each search were limited to 20 items.
When a user logs into the application, he will be redirected to the home page, where he can search for recipes. He can also click a button that takes him or her to a page where he or she can view nearby restaurants.
When the nearby restaurant page loads for the first time, a prompt will appear asking the user to allow the application to know his or her location. Click on Allow. A map showing all the nearby restaurants will be displayed with a red location icon on the map. Click on each icon to see the details of the restaurant. A search box at the top of the page can also be used by the user to search for nearby restaurants.
When a user searches for restaurants not located within his or her city, an error message that the restaurant is not within the city will be displayed at the bottom right of the screen.
The application is responsive on both desktop and mobile screens.
